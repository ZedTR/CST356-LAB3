Excercise 1:
1-the Key attribute will override the existing convention in (code first migration) and force the property 'Id' in this case
to be the primary key in the Table created for the User entity.
7-the connection string sill specify that the entity framework will be using the specified local data base, the string 'catalog=' will 
specify the name of the database to be created and the 'AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|\' will ensure that the data
base will be created in APP_Start folder.
14- I believe this would happen because the data base being replaced with a new table, but if 'enable-migrations' being used in the Nuget
package explorer that will make the enable code first migration.

Excercise 2:
1-To reduce the logic from the views, increase security and to provide loose coupling for the entity models.
